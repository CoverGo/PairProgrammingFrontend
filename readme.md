# Pair programming interview - frontend

Dear candidate, we are glad to see you soon at a pair programming session. 
You’ll spend 1 - 2 hours with our developers working on a task and coding.

We would like you to shine and kindly suggest you prepare the most convenient
development environment to have a pleasant & productive exercise. 

We expect you to have the following ready before joining the session:
+ Properly configured your IDE of choice;
+ Created an empty Vue project;
+ Installed Tailwind css into the project (optional)

We will be coding in Vue.js version 2 or 3. For the CSS, you preferably use Tailwind css or you can also use vanilla css.

The task will consist of several requirements, which will be given to you one by one.
CoverGo developers are playing Business Analyst roles and will provide you all information about requirements and will answer questions. After you say that the requirement is fulfilled, we’ll give you the next one. 
After all the requirements are implemented, you’ll have some time for refactoring. After refactoring we’ll have a technical discussion about your code and design decisions behind.

All the task requirements are pretty simple and could be implemented without data structures, algorithmic complexity knowledge or advanced math. 
The success criteria for the pair programming are: the ability to write a good-quality code using best industry practices in a reasonable amount of time. 

We are expecting you to demonstrate mastery in the following areas: 

+ Clean & Maintainable Code
+ User-centric approach with the best frontend UX practices in mind
+ Modern component-driven approach
+ IDE usage
+ Design Patterns

Huge plus is if you demonstrate:

+ Modern JavaScript features beyond ES2017 (especially async/await)
+ Eye for design
